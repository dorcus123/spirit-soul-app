                <h1 class="page-title">About Spirit & Soul</h1>
                
                <div class="about-section">
                    <h2> Spirit & Soul was created from a sacred place of encounter, obedience, and transformation.</h2>
                    <p>

                        I am Dorcus Nagadya, the founder of Spirit & Soul, and this app was birthed through my personal walk with God through seasons of isolation, deep spiritual encounters, emotional healing, and divine repositioning. It was created not from theory, but from  my lived experience in the presence of God.
                        
                        There were moments where loneliness became a sanctuary, trauma became a doorway, and silence became the place where God spoke the loudest. In those hidden seasons, God began to realign my spirit, heal my soul, and sharpen my discernment. What felt like separation was actually preparation.
                        
                        As a prophetess and intercessor, I have learned that God often pulls us away so He can speak clearly stripping distractions, healing wounds, and restoring identity. Spirit & Soul was formed in those moments of alignment, where I learned to listen, journal, reflect, worship, as well as strengthening my spiritual practices, to receive God’s voice in the quiet places of the heart.
                        
                        This app exists because I needed it myself and for the people that God has entrusted me with.
                        
                        Spirit & Soul was created as a sacred digital space for those navigating emotional weight, spiritual growth, healing from trauma, and longing for deeper intimacy with God. It is a reflection of my journey of repositioning choosing obedience over world noise, alignment over survival,and intimacy with God over performance and strategically waiting for the devine time.
                        
                        Spirit & Soul is also an expression of divine instruction.
                        
                        As a single mother who has experienced God’s help, provision, and faithfulness firsthand, I've always  carried a burden to reach beyond myself to widows, single mothers, and orphans "children", especially in Uganda Africa were i come from, who are in need of support, covering, and hope. Spirit & Soul carries a call not only to spiritual growth, but to compassionate action.
                        
                        Within this space, there is a place for prayer and intercession a place where we can stand in the gap together, lifting up lives, families, and nations before God. There is also an opportunity to give, for those whom God leads, toward helping widows and children who lack housing, school fees, food, clothing, and basic care. Every act of generosity flows from prayer and obedience, not obligation.
                        
                        Spirit & Soul exists because I believe the presence of God should lead us both inward for healing and outward for service.
                        
                        Every devotional, prompt, reflection, and outreach is rooted in the belief that:
                            •	God cares deeply about our emotions
                            •	Healing is both spiritual and emotional
                            •	God still speaks
                            •	Prayer changes lives
                            •	And love must be expressed through action
                        
                        Spirit & Soul is an invitation to pause, breathe, listen, pray, and respond to allow God to meet you exactly where you are, and to join God in caring for others just as He met me.
                        
                        This platform is not about perfection.
                        It is about presence.
                        It is not about religion.
                        It is about relationship.
                        It is not only about personal growth.
                        It is about obedience to God’s heart for people.
                        
                        Spirit & Soul was created to help others find what I found:
                        peace in God’s presence, clarity in His voice, healing in His truth, and purpose in serving others.</p>
